### Renaming Tables
You can also use the ALTER TABLE command to rename a table. 
As an example, here’s how you’d rename the DRINK table to FOO:
![](.guides/img/47.png)


### Delete tables by dropping them
In addition to creating and altering tables, you can delete them using the DROP TABLE command:

![](.guides/img/48.png)

This command is useful if you have a table in your database schema that you don't need anymore, and want to remove it to save space.
