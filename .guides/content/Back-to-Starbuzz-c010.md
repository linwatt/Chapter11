We're going to revisit the Starbuzz app we created in Chapter 6. 

Currently, the Starbuzz database gets its drink data from a `Drink` class containing a selection of drinks available at Starbuzz. While this made building the first version of the app easier, there's a better way of storing and persisting data. 

We're going to change the Starbuzz database so it gets its data from a SQLite database. In this chapter, we're going to create the database.
