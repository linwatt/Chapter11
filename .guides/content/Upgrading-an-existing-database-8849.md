When you need to upgrade your database, there are two types of actions you might want to perform:
- **Change the database records.**
Earlier on in the chapter, you saw how to insert, update, or delete records in your database using the `SQLiteDatabase insert()`, `update()`, and `delete()` methods. You may add more records when you upgrade the database, or change or remove the records that are already there.

- **Change the database structure.**
You’ve already seen how you can create tables in the database. You may also want to add columns to existing tables, rename tables, or remove tables completely.
